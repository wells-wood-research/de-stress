# compile
g++ calene.cc -o calene
or using intel compiler
icpc calene.cc -o calene

#usage: calene dfire_pair.lib ...;  followed with PDB files
# The program explains itself.
# benchmark
bash# time ./calene dfire_pair.lib pro.pdb
pro.pdb -510.9
real	0m0.431s

# If you're interested in interaction between CA atoms, or between CB (CA for GLY) atoms, you can use program calene_part with option "-CA" or "-CB", respectively.
#usage: calene_part dfire_pair.lib [-CA|-CB] ...;  followed with PDB files
# benchmark
bash# time ./calene_part dfire_pair.lib -CA pro.pdb 
pro.pdb -10.9
real	0m0.480s
#The result is exactly same as "calene" on PDB file with CA atoms only
bash# time ./calene dfire_pair.lib pro_CA.pdb 
pro_CA.pdb -10.9
real	0m0.475s

# Tips
# The potential library file is exactly same when partial atoms are used to calculate the energy, and what you need to do is removing other atoms from the PDB files or change the program a little  at line 59 to filter unused atoms
